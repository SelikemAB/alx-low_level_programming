# Low-level programming & Algorithm
> A module of Low-level programming and algorithm, carried out during ALX Full Stack Software Engineering Program Cohort 12.
## Technologies
- C files are compiled using gcc 9.4.0
- C files are written according to the Linux Kernel Coding Style.
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04
